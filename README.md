# Cleaning Projects for Real-World Data Science

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of practical projects focused on the critical first steps of any data science workflow: data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The projects within this collection demonstrate various techniques for transforming raw, messy data into clean, structured, and analysis-ready datasets.

## üìñ About This Collection

In real-world scenarios, data is rarely perfect. It often contains missing values, inconsistencies, incorrect formats, and outliers. This collection provides hands-on examples of how to systematically identify and address these issues. Each project is contained within a Jupyter Notebook and walks through the process of cleaning and preparing a dataset for machine learning or in-depth analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Concepts & Techniques Demonstrated

Across these projects, you will find practical applications of the following data preparation techniques:

- **Handling Missing Data**: Strategies for imputing or removing null values (e.g., mean, median, mode imputation).
- **Data Standardization & Normalization**: Scaling numerical features to a common range.
- **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Identifying and managing anomalous data points.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Correcting and standardizing data types across columns.
- **Categorical Data Encoding**: Converting text-based categories into numerical representations (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new, meaningful features from existing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using visualizations to understand data distributions, relationships, and anomalies.
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring data conforms to expected rules and formats.

## üìÇ Projects Included

This repository contains several standalone projects, including:

- **Comprehensive Titanic Data Analysis**: A classic project involving extensive feature engineering and data cleaning to prepare the dataset for survival prediction.
- **House Price Prediction Preprocessing**: Techniques for cleaning and preparing a housing dataset with numerous numerical and categorical features.
- **Iris Dataset Preparation**: A foundational example of splitting and preparing a clean dataset for classification models.
- **General Data Cleaning Workflows**: Notebooks demonstrating specific techniques like standardization, validation, and general preprocessing steps on various datasets.

## üíª Technologies & Libraries Used

The projects are primarily built using Python and the following core data science libraries:

| Library              | Purpose                                      |
